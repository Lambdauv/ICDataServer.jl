Many if not all of the functions detailed in this API are really just
convenience functions wrapped around methods in the
[`ODBC.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDB/ODBC.jl) package, with some syntax
specific to how we have set up our databases.

Often a `dsn` argument is requested. You can provide `ICDataServer.dsn`.
